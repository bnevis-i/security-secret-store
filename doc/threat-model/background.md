## Hardware Secure Storage Roadmap

The EdgeX Foundry has called for hardware secure storage:

*Initial EdgeX secrets (needed to start Vault/Kong) will be encrypted on  the file system using a secure storage abstraction layer â€“ allowing other implementations to store these in hardware stores (based on hardware root of trust systems)*

## Hardware Secure Storage Draft Proposal

The current state of secret storage is described in the Hardware Secure Storage Draft (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MsTNdwtZp3zA-nPhCC3COakL3e5mrhJuFByy6ja5OxU/edit).

The AS-IS architecture resembles the following diagram:

![AS-IS](arch-as-is.png)

As the diagram notes, the critical secrets for securing the entire on-device infrastructure sit unencrypted on bulk storage media. That the Vault contents is shown as encrypted is misleading: the master key to decrypt the vault is in plaintext nearby. Moreover, the current state is actually worse pictured, as some of these root secrets, in the containerized incarnation of the EdgeX Framework, are mistakenly included in the container images themselves.

The Hardware Secure Storage Draft proposes the following future state:

![Proposed future state](arch-proposed.png)

This future state proposes a security service that can encrypt the currently unencrypted data items.

A number of problems must be resolved to make this future state a reality:

* Initialization order of containers: containers must block until their prerequisites have been satisfied. It is not sufficient to have only start-ordering, as initialization can take a variable amount of time, and the initialization tasks of a previous step are not necessarily completed before the next step is initiated.
* Allowing for variability in the hardware encryption component.  A simple bulk encryption/decryption interface does not allow for interesting scenarios based on local attestation, for example.
* Distribution of Vault tokens to services.

## Next Steps

While it is a good start, encrypting the root secrets does not itself result in a robust secret management design. What is needed is a systematic approach to secret management that will close the gaps between the AS-IS and TO-BE future state.  This systematic approach is based on formal threat model with the aim that the system will meet some critical security objectives, which include, among others:

- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of application secrets.
- Prevent off-line copying of application secrets by binding them to secure hardware storage.

Through threat modeling, we can identify assets, adversaries, threats, and mitigations against those threats.  We can then make a prioritized implementation plan to address those threats.


## Thoughts on System Management Agent

The [system management design](https://wiki.edgexfoundry.org/download/attachments/17498212/System%20Management%20Design-v8-Delhi-final.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1534870659000&api=v2) proposes the existence of an agent that can start and stop EdgeX services via two [executors](https://wiki.edgexfoundry.org/display/FA/Systems+Management+Working+Group?preview=/329501/27492359/SMA-start-stop-restart-interface-v4.pdf): the docker-compose executor and the Linux OS executor. There are both opportunities and challenges for integrating with the system management agent.

Opportunties for SMA integration:
* System Management Agent is in an ideal position to inject some bootstrapping secrets via tmpfs or an environment variable into the services that it starts. This is the best case scenario for secret management as the service need not then prove its identity at a later phase.

Challenges for SMA integration:
* SMA is currently an optional service.  If only the SMA is allowed to inject a bootstrapping secret into a service then it becomes a required element of the secret management stack.
* The Linux OS executor does not require the started services to have separate UIDs/GIDs. The lack of enforced isolation between services started this way would invalidate many of the threat migitigations for secret management.
* The docker-compose executor would provide for service isolation, but it would have to modify docker-compose files on-the-fly in order to inject bootstrapping secrets.
* In order for the SMA to obtain services' bootstrapping secrets, SMA would have to authenticate itself to another microservice that provides such secrets, or be started with a privileged token passed to SMA so that SMA could generate the bootstrapping secrets itself.  Both of these imply that SMA would have to be started later in the boot phase after the secret management subsystem was initialized.
